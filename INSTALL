# Installation Instructions

*************************
## _Original Game Data Files_
  Due to licence restrictions, we don't distribute the original game data files. You should have a copy of Syndicate or buy it.

  In order to run FreeSynd, either copy all files from the original Syndicate "DATA" directory into the FreeSynd "data" directory, or edit the FreeSynd configuration to indicate where the original game's "DATA" directory is (see "Configuring FreeSynd" below). 

  At first run Freesynd will test files located in your Syndicate "DATA" directory to verify that required files are present and are correct.

> **Attention** : Please, be sure to have files from the first version of Syndicate as FreeSynd does not support files from Syndicate Plus or Syndicate Wars.

*************************

## Installation

### From binary distribution file

#### Windows
    1/ Download and unzip the file in any directory you want.
           This directory will be called FS_ROOT in the following text.
	2/ Install original game data files (see chapter "Original Game Data).
	3/ Optionnaly edit FS_ROOT/bin/freesynd.ini to indicate where to find original 
	   game data files (see chapter "Configuring FreeSynd")
	4/ Run FS_ROOT/bin/freesynd.exe.

#### Mac
    1/ Unzip the application bundle and drag it to your "Applications" folder.
		
#### Linux
    See next chapter : Building from source
    

### From building from source (packaged file or Git)
Download and unzip file containing source code in any directory you want or git clone the repository.
The root directory containing the source code will be called *FS_ROOT* in the following text.

> **Attention** : This file only describe the installation from the CLI for a quick setup. If you want to configure a full Development Environment, please consult this [WikiPage](https://sourceforge.net/p/freesynd/wiki/Dev_Env_Install/).

#### Prerequisites
**Note**: For more information on how to setup those prerequisites for your plateform, please consult this [Wiki Page](https://sourceforge.net/p/freesynd/wiki/Dev_Env_Install/#requirements).

    1/ To build Freesynd, you will need to install [Cmake 3.22](https://cmake.org/)
    2/ A C++ compiler
	3/ Install the required Libraries. Freesynd needs the following libraries to build and run :
    - SDL-1.2
    - SDL_mixer
    - SDL_image
    - Png

**Note** : On Windows, required librairies (for development and run) are available with the source code (in the /extern/MSVC directory)

#### Notes on running CMake
- When building the source code (option `--build`), use `-G"My tool"` to specify a particular build system. See CMake documentation for a list of options.
- It is a best practice to specify a build directory inside the source code directory. Name your build directory starting with "build" so that Git ignores it automatically.

**CMake Options**
 - TBD

#### Windows
From the command line :

	$ cd FS_ROOT
	$ cmake -S . -B build
	$ cmake --build build

Then you need to copy all dll files that are in FS_ROOT/extern/MSVC/lib/ to the directory where the feesynd.exe file has been generated.

#### Linux
From the command line :

	$ cd FS_ROOT
	$ cmake -S . -B build
	$ cmake --build build
	
Install the application :

    $ sudo make install

#### Mac
From the command line :

	$ cd FS_ROOT
	$ cmake -S . -B build
	$ cmake --build build


## Configuring FreeSynd

FreeSynd reads the file `freesynd.ini` to get its running configuration.
You can edit the file with any text editor to customize your installation.
When you run FreeSynd, a default ini file will be created for you if it does not already exist.

The location of `freesynd.ini` is different on each platform.
  * Windows: the folder containing freesynd.exe
  * Linux: $HOME/.freesynd/
  * Mac: $HOME/Library/Application Support/FreeSynd/

  (For Mac users who prefer the Linux/Unix way of doing things, a symlink will
be created at $HOME/.freesynd for your convenience.)

  The default location of `freesynd.ini` can be overridden on the command line.
Run freesynd --help to see usage information.

Here is a description of each of the config file parameters:
- `test_data`: (true/false) If true, the game will look for Original Syndicate Data and test it
- `fullscreen`: (true/false) If true, the game will run in fullscreen mode.
- `play_intro`: (true/false) If true, the introduction will be played.
- `freesynd_data_dir`: Path to the FreeSynd "data" directory. This parameter should have a sensible default. Only set this if you really need to.
- `data_dir`: Path to the original Syndicate "DATA" directory. By default, this will be the same as `freesynd_data_dir`.
- `language`: 0:english, 1:fran√ßais, 2:italiano, 3:deutsch, 4 spanish 

After launch, `play_intro` will be turned off automatically.


## Saved Games
Saved games are located in a different place on each platform.  

- Windows: the folder containing freesynd.exe, + "save"
- Linux: $HOME/.freesynd/save/
- Mac: $HOME/Library/Application Support/FreeSynd/save/

You may note that this location is based on the default ini file location.
The saved games location will not be affected by specifying a different path for the ini file on the command line.
